    "**Exercise:** Let's consider [a more general version of the Monty Hall problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem#Other_host_behaviors) where Monty is more unpredictable.  As before, Monty never opens the door you chose (let's call it A) and never opens the door with the prize.  So if you choose the door with the prize, Monty has to decide which door to open.  Suppose he opens B with probability `p` and C with probability `1-p`.\n",
