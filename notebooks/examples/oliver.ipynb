    "blood. The blood groups of the two traces are found to be of type\n",
    "‘O’ (a common type in the local population, having frequency 60%)\n",
    "and of type ‘AB’ (a rare type, with frequency 1%). Do these data\n",
    "(type ‘O’ and ‘AB’ blood were found at scene) give evidence in\n",
    "favour of the proposition that Oliver was one of the two people\n",
    "present at the crime?\n",
    "\n",
    "MacKay suggests formulating the problem like this:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Denote the proposition ‘the suspect and one unknown person were present’ by `S`. The alternative, `S̄`, states ‘two unknown people from the population were present’.\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Some people are initially unsure why there is a factor of two in the second equation.  One way to convince yourself that it is correct is a verbal argument:  \"If Oliver did not leave a blood trace at the scene, then the blood traces were left by two unknown people.  If we consider these unknown people in order, the first might have left type ‘O’ blood and the second might have left type ‘AB’, or the other way around.  Since there are two ways to account for the data, we have to add their probabilities.\"\n",
