1. The production programs are p_met_ts.f, p_metr_ts.f and p_met_tsm.f.

2. The analysis programs are ana_ts_p.f, ana_ts_pr.f and ana_ts_pm.f.

3. Plot the results with at1.plt, at1r.plt and at1m.plt.

For L=10 lattices only: Plot with atest10.plt.

(A) Plot with at1.plt.

(B) Plot with at1r.plt.

(C) ana_ts_pm.f calculates the improvement ratio from p_met_ts.f to p_met_tsm.f. 
    Plot  the integrated autocorrelation times with at1m.plt.
