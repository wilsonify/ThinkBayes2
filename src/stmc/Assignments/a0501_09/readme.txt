MUCA with time series
=====================

Test case 2d 10-state Potts  model on a 20x20 lattice (the same as in 
the previous assignments).

1. Compile and run p_mu_ts.f which generates the time series
   file  mu2d10q020lts.D.                        ===========

2. Compile and run ana_pmu_ts.f for the analysis of this data set.
   Created are a bunch of data files fln.d. Plot with the *.plt files.
   The full lines are exact results, the data points are from the time
   series analysis.
