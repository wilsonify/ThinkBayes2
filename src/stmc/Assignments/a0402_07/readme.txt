   Comparision of the 1-hit Metropolis versus 
   the heat bath algorithm for the 3d Ising
   model at Tc and below.

   Lattice size = 14**3 on lnx20.

1. Compile and run the production programs
   p_met_ts.f, p_metn_ts.f and p_hb_ts.f.

2. Compile and run the analysis programs.

3. Run efficiency.f to get the comparision.
   See the program file for the input data,
   which are compile from the a*.d* files
   (autocorrelation times) and *.r files
   (CPU times).
