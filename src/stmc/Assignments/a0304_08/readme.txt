o3_tshb.f     Heat bath  for the O3 (Heisenberg) model.

              Peaked distribution functions.
              ==============================

Create data for chosen lattice size with o3_tshb.f.

Run analysis ana_qdf.f and plot with resulting driver qdf01.plt.

Rename data file for later plot with qdf.plt and continue with the
next lattice size.
