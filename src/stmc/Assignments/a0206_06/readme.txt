The distribution function is

F2x(y) = {0 for y.le.0}, {y**2/2 for 0.le.y.le.(1/2)},
         {y*(-y+4)/2-1 for (1/2).le.y.le.1}, {one for y.ge.1}.

(a) Compile and run two_xr_a.f -> k2_as_a.d. Gnuplot k2_as_a.plt.
    (The Q for the first data set is explicitely printed out.)

(b) Compile and run two_xr_b.f -> k2_as_b.d. Gnuplot k2_as_b.plt.
    (The Q for the first data set is explicitely printed out.)

(c) The numbers are printed at the end of the runs under (a) and (b).
