1. Create jackknife data files with ac.f. 
   Gnuplots with ac.plt.

   The jackknife data can be removed with rm -f datj*.d.

2. Perform fit with lfitj.f and record the results for
   the exponential and integrated autocorrelation times.
   Gnuplots with fit.plt, lfit.plt, ellipse.plt and gaudif.plt.
