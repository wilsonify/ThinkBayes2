For the master programs:
========================

lat3d.f  3d lattice: Before compiling, copy lat3d.par to lat.par 
                     and lat3d.dat to lat.dat.

lat4d.f  4d lattice: Before compiling, copy lat4d.par to lat.par 
                     and lat4d.dat to lat.dat.

The other programs:
===================

lat222.f, lat224.f and lat333.f,

are ready to run, because they include directly the relevant
data files (for master programs the generic structure should
not be changed!).
