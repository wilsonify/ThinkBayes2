# ## The Euro problem
#
# Problem statement here.
#
# Here's a more efficient version of the Euro class that takes the dataset in a more compact form and uses the binomial distribution (ignoring the binomial coefficient because it does not depend on `x`).

class Euro(Suite):
    """Represents hypotheses about the probability of heads."""

    def Likelihood(self, data, hypo):
        """Computes the likelihood of the data under the hypothesis.

        hypo: integer value of x, the probability of heads (0-100)
        data: tuple of (number of heads, number of tails)
        """
        x = hypo / 100.0
        heads, tails = data
        like = x**heads * (1-x)**tails
        return like


# If we know the coin is fair, we can evaluate the likelihood of the data directly.

data = 140, 110

suite = Euro()
like_f = suite.Likelihood(data, 50)
print('p(D|F)', like_f)

# If we cheat an pretend that the alternative hypothesis is exactly the observed proportion, we can compute the likelihood of the data and the likelihood ratio, relative to the fair coin. 

actual_percent = 100.0 * 140 / 250
likelihood = suite.Likelihood(data, actual_percent)
print('p(D|B_cheat)', likelihood)
print('p(D|B_cheat) / p(D|F)', likelihood / like_f)

# Under this interpretation, the data are in favor of "biased", with K=6.  But that's a total cheat.
#
# Suppose we think "biased" means either 0.4 or 0.6, but we're not sure which.  The total likelihood of the data is the weighted average of the two likelihoods.

like40 = suite.Likelihood(data, 40)

likelihood = 0.5 * like40 + 0.5 * like60
print('p(D|B_two)', likelihood)
print('p(D|B_two) / p(D|F)', likelihood / like_f)


# Under this interpretation, the data are in favor of "biased", but very weak.
#
# More generally, if "biased" refers to a range of possibilities with different probabilities, the total likelihood of the data is the weighted sum:

def SuiteLikelihood(suite, data):
    """Computes the weighted average of likelihoods for sub-hypotheses.

    suite: Suite that maps sub-hypotheses to probability
    data: some representation of the data
   
    returns: float likelihood
    """
    total = 0
    for hypo, prob in suite.Items():
        like = suite.Likelihood(data, hypo)
        total += prob * like
    return total


# Here's what it looks like if "biased" means "equally likely to be any value between 0 and 1".

b_uniform = Euro(range(0, 101))
b_uniform.Remove(50)
b_uniform.Normalize()
likelihood = SuiteLikelihood(b_uniform, data)
print('p(D|B_uniform)', likelihood)
print('p(D|B_uniform) / p(D|F)', likelihood / like_f)


# By that definition, the data are evidence against the biased hypothesis, with K=2.
#
# But maybe a triangle prior is a better model of what "biased" means.

def TrianglePrior():
    """Makes a Suite with a triangular prior."""
    suite = Euro()
    for x in range(0, 51):
        suite.Set(x, x)
    for x in range(51, 101):
        suite.Set(x, 100-x) 
    suite.Normalize()
    return suite


# Here's what it looks like:

b_tri = TrianglePrior()
b_tri.Remove(50)
b_tri.Normalize()
likelihood = b_tri.Update(data)
print('p(D|B_tri)', likelihood)
print('p(D|B_tri) / p(D|F)', likelihood / like_f)

# By the triangle definition of "biased", the data are very weakly in favor of "fair".
#
# ## Normalizing constant
#
# We don't really need the SuiteLikelihood function, because `Suite.Update` already computes the total probability of the data, which is the normalizing constant.

likelihood = SuiteLikelihood(b_uniform, data)
likelihood

euro = Euro(b_uniform)
euro.Update(data)

likelihood = SuiteLikelihood(b_tri, data)

euro = Euro(b_tri)
euro.Update(data)

# This observation is the basis of hierarchical Bayesian models, of which this solution to the Euro problem is a simple example.
