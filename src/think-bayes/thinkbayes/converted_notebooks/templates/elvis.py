# **Exercise:** This exercise is from one of my favorite books, David MacKay's "Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms":
#
# > Elvis Presley had a twin brother who died at birth.  What is the probability that Elvis was an identical twin?"
#     
# To answer this one, you need some background information: According to the Wikipedia article on twins:  "Twins are estimated to be approximately 1.9% of the world population, with monozygotic twins making up 0.2% of the total---and 8% of all twins.''
