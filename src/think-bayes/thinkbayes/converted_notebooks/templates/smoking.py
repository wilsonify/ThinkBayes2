# ## Smoking problem
#
# According to the CDC, "Compared to nonsmokers, men who smoke are about 23 times more likely to develop lung cancer and women who smoke are about 13 times more likely.''
#
# Also, among adults in the U.S. in 2014:
#
# > Nearly 19 of every 100 adult men (18.8%)
# > Nearly 15 of every 100 adult women (14.8%)
#
# **Exercise:** If you learn that a woman has been diagnosed with lung cancer, and you know nothing else about her, what is the probability that she is a smoker?
