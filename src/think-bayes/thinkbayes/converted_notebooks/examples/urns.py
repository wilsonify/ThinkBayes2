# Here's a problem from Joyce, "[How probabilities reflect evidence](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jjoyce/papers/hpre.pdf)":
#
# >Four Urns: Jacob and Emily both start out knowing that the urn U was
# randomly chosen from a set of four urns {urn0, urn1, urn2, urn3} where urn_i
# contains three balls, i of which are blue and 3-i of which are green. Since the
# choice of U was random both subjects assign equal credence to the four
# hypotheses about its contents: c(U = urn_i) = 1/4. Moreover, both treat these
# hypotheses as statements about the objective chance of drawing a blue ball from
# U, so that knowledge of U = urn_i ‘screen offs’ any sampling data in the sense
# that c(Bnext |E & U = urn_i) = c(Bnext | U = urni), where Bnext says that the next
# ball drawn from the urn will be blue and E is a proposition that describes any
# prior series of random draws with replacement from U. Finally, Jacob and
# Emily regard random drawing with replacement as an exchangeable process,
# so that any series of draws that produces m blue balls and n green balls is as
# likely as any other such series, irrespective of order. Use BmGn to denote the
# generic event in which m blue balls and n green balls are drawn at random and
# with replacement form U. Against this backdrop of shared evidence, suppose
# Jacob sees five balls drawn at random and with replacement from U and
# observes that all are blue, so his evidence is B5G0. Emily, who sees Jacob’s
# evidence, looks at fifteen additional draws of which twelve come up blue, so her
# evidence is B17G3. What should Emily and Jacob think about Bnext?
#
# Here's a class that represents a suite of hypotheses about the urns:

class Urns(Suite):
    
    def Likelihood(self, data, hypo):
        """Computes the likelihood of the data under the hypothesis.
        
        data: 'B' or 'G'
        hypo: urn index from 0..3
        """
        prob_blue = hypo / 3
        if data == 'B':
            return prob_blue
        else:
            return 1-prob_blue


# Here's the uniform prior:

prior = Urns([0, 1, 2, 3])
tplt.Hist(prior)
tplt.decorate(xlabel='Urn index (i)', ylabel='PMF')

# Here's Jacob's update after 5 blue marbles.

jacob = prior.Copy()
B5G0 = 'B'*5

for data in B5G0:
    jacob.Update(data)

jacob.Print()
# -

tplt.Hist(prior, color='gray')
tplt.Hist(jacob)
tplt.decorate(xlabel='Urn index (i)', ylabel='PMF')

# Here's Emily's update after an additional 12 blue and 3 green.

emily = jacob.Copy()
B12G3 = 'B'*12 + 'G'*3

for data in B12G3:
    emily.Update(data)

emily.Print()

# +
tplt.preplot(cols=2)
tplt.Hist(jacob, label='Jacob')
tplt.decorate(xlabel='Urn index (i)', ylabel='PMF')

tplt.subplot(2)
tplt.Hist(emily, label='Emily')
tplt.decorate(xlabel='Urn index (i)', ylabel='PMF')

total = 0
for i, prob_i in jacob.Items():

    prob_blue = i/3
    total += prob_i * prob_blue

# Let's make it a function:

def prob_b_next(suite):
    total = 0
    for i, prob_i in suite.Items():
        prob_blue = i/3

# And Emily.

prob_b_next(emily)

# Suppose we draw a **blue** marble from the same urn and show it to Jacob and Emily.  How much do their beliefs about Bnext change?
#
# Here's the effect on Jacob.

print(prob_b_next(jacob))

# And on Emily.

print(prob_b_next(emily))

# Suppose we draw a **green** marble from the same urn and show it to Jacob and Emily.  How much do their beliefs about Bnext change?
