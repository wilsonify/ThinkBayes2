# ### The height problem
#
# For adult male residents of the US, the mean and standard deviation of height are 178 cm and 7.7 cm.  For adult female residents the corresponding stats are 163 cm and 7.3 cm.  Suppose you learn that someone is 170 cm tall.  What is the probability that they are male? 
#
# Run this analysis again for a range of observed heights from 150 cm to 200 cm, and plot a curve that shows P(male) versus height.  What is the mathematical form of this function?

# To represent the likelihood functions, I'll use `norm` from `scipy.stats`, which returns a "frozen" random variable (RV) that represents a normal distribution with given parameters.
#

# +
from scipy.stats import norm

dist_height = dict(male=norm(178, 7.7),
                   female=norm(163, 7.3))


# -

# Write a class that implements `Likelihood` using the frozen distributions.  Here's starter code:

class Height(Suite):
    
    def Likelihood(self, data, hypo):
        """
        data: height in cm
        hypo: 'male' or 'female'
        """
        return 1


# +
# Solution goes here
# -

# Here's the prior.

suite = Height(['male', 'female'])
for hypo, prob in suite.Items():
    print(hypo, prob)

# And the update:

suite.Update(170)
for hypo, prob in suite.Items():
    print(hypo, prob)

# Compute the probability of being male as a function of height, for a range of values between 150 and 200.

# Solution goes here

# If you are curious, you can derive the mathematical form of this curve from the PDF of the normal distribution.

# ### How tall is A?
#
# Suppose I choose two residents of the U.S. at random.  A is taller than B.  How tall is A?
#
# What if I tell you that A is taller than B by more than 5 cm.  How tall is A?
#
# For adult male residents of the US, the mean and standard deviation of height are 178 cm and 7.7 cm.  For adult female residents the corresponding stats are 163 cm and 7.3 cm.

# Here are distributions that represent the heights of men and women in the U.S.

dist_height = dict(male=norm(178, 7.7),
                   female=norm(163, 7.3))

hs = np.linspace(130, 210)
ps = dist_height['male'].pdf(hs)
male_height_pmf = Pmf(dict(zip(hs, ps)));

ps = dist_height['female'].pdf(hs)
female_height_pmf = Pmf(dict(zip(hs, ps)));

# +
thinkplot.Pdf(male_height_pmf, label='Male')
thinkplot.Pdf(female_height_pmf, label='Female')

thinkplot.decorate(xlabel='Height (cm)',
                   ylabel='PMF',
                   title='Adult residents of the U.S.')
# -

# Use `thinkbayes2.MakeMixture` to make a `Pmf` that represents the height of all residents of the U.S.

                   title='Posterior joint distribution')

# Update your `Suite`, then plot the joint distribution and the marginal distribution, and compute the posterior means for `A` and `B`.
