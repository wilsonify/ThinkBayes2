    # ## Exercises

    # **Exercise:** To write a likelihood function for the locomotive problem, we had
    # to answer this question:  "If the railroad has `N` locomotives, what
    # is the probability that we see number 60?"
    #
    # The answer depends on what sampling process we use when we observe the
    # locomotive.  In the book, I resolved the ambiguity by specifying
    # that there is only one train-operating company (or only one that we
    # care about).
    #
    # But suppose instead that there are many companies with different
    # numbers of trains.  And suppose that you are equally likely to see any
    # train operated by any company.
    # In that case, the likelihood function is different because you
    # are more likely to see a train operated by a large company.
    #
    # As an exercise, implement the likelihood function for this variation
    # of the locomotive problem, and compare the results.

    # Solution goes here
