    # ## Exercises

    # **Exercise:** To write a likelihood function for the locomotive problem, we had
    # to answer this question:  "If the railroad has `N` locomotives, what
    # is the probability that we see number 60?"
    #
    # The answer depends on what sampling process we use when we observe the
    # locomotive.  In the book, I resolved the ambiguity by specifying
    # that there is only one train-operating company (or only one that we
    # care about).
    #
    # But suppose instead that there are many companies with different
    # numbers of trains.  And suppose that you are equally likely to see any
    # train operated by any company.
    # In that case, the likelihood function is different because you
    # are more likely to see a train operated by a large company.
    #
    # As an exercise, implement the likelihood function for this variation
    # of the locomotive problem, and compare the results.

    #
    # The answer depends on what sampling process we use when we observe the

    #
    # As an exercise, implement the likelihood function for this variation
    # of the locomotive problem, and compare the results.

    # Solution

    # Suppose Company A has N trains and all other companies have M.
    # The chance that we would observe one of Company A's trains is $N/(N+M)$.
    # Given that we observe one of Company A's trains, the chance that we
    # observe number 60 is $1/N$ for $N \ge 60$.

    # The product of these probabilities is $1/(N+M)$, which is just the
    # probability of observing any given train.

    # If N<<M, this converges to a constant, which means that all value of $N$
    # have the same likelihood, so we learn nothing about how many trains
    # Company A has.

    # If N>>M, this converges to $1/N$, which is what we saw in the previous
    # solution.

    # More generally, if M is unknown, we would need a prior distribution for
    # M, then we can do a two-dimensional update, and then extract the posterior
    # distribution for N.

    # We'll see how to do that soon.
