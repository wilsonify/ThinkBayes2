# ## Cats and rats and elephants
#
# Suppose there are six species that might be in a zoo: lions and tigers and bears, and cats and rats and elephants.  Every zoo has a subset of these species, and every subset is equally likely.
#
# One day we visit a zoo and see 3 lions, 2 tigers, and one bear.  Assuming that every animal in the zoo has an equal chance to be seen, what is the probability that the next animal we see is an elephant?
#
#
# ## Solution
#
# I'll start by enumerating all possible zoos with `itertools`.
