    The Space Shuttle problem
    Here's a problem from [Bayesian Methods for Hackers](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/blob/master/Chapter2_MorePyMC/Ch2_MorePyMC_PyMC2.ipynb)
    >On January 28, 1986, the twenty-fifth flight of the U.S. space shuttle program ended in disaster
    when one of the rocket boosters of the Shuttle Challenger exploded shortly after lift-off,
    killing all seven crew members.
    The presidential commission on the accident concluded that it was caused by the failure of an O-ring
    in a field joint on the rocket booster, and that this failure was due to a faulty design that
    made the O-ring unacceptably sensitive to a number of factors including outside temperature.
    Of the previous 24 flights, data were available on failures of O-rings on 23,
    (one was lost at sea), and these data were discussed on the evening preceding the Challenger launch,
    but unfortunately only the data corresponding to the 7 flights on which there was a damage incident
    were considered important and these were thought to show no obvious trend.
    The data are shown below (see [1](https://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01621459.1989.10478858)):

    #
    # $\mathrm{logit}(p) = b0 + b1 * T$
    #
    # and each datum being a temperature `T` and a boolean outcome `fail`, which is true is there was damage and false otherwise.

    # Hint: the `expit` function from `scipy.special` computes the inverse of the `logit` function.
