    # Suppose you are a doctor treating a 40-year old female patient.  After she gets a routine screening mammogram, the result comes back positive (defined below).
    #
    # The patient asks whether this result indicates that she has breast cancer.  You interpret this question as, "What is the probability that this patient has breast cancer, given a positive test result?"
    #
    # How would you respond?
    #
    # The following background information from the Breast Cancer Screening Consortium (BCSC) might help:

    # ### Assumptions and interpretation
    #
    # According to [the first table](http://www.bcsc-research.org/statistics/performance/screening/2009/rate_age.html), the cancer rate per 1000 examinations is 2.65 for women age 40-44.  The notes explain that this rate is based on "the number of examinations with a tissue diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive cancer within 1 year following the examination and before the next screening mammography examination", so it would be more precise to say that it is the rate of diagnosis within a year of the examination, not the rate of actual cancers.
    #
    # Since untreated invasive breast cancer is likely to become symptomatic, we expect a large fraction of cancers to be diagnosed eventually.  But there might be a long delay between developing a cancer and diagnosis, and a patient might die of another cause before diagnosis.  So we should consider this rate as a lower bound on the probability that a patient has cancer at the time of the examination.
    #
    # According to [the second table](http://www.bcsc-research.org/statistics/performance/screening/2009/perf_age.html), the sensitivity of the test for women in this age group is 73.4%; the specificity is 87.7%.  From these, we can get the conditional probabilities:
    #
    # ```
    # P(positive test | cancer) = sensitivity
    # P(positive test | no cancer) = (1 - specificity)
    # ```
    #
    # Now we can use a Bayes table to compute the probability we are interested in, `P(cancer | positive test)`

    base_rate = 2.65 / 1000
    hypo = ["cancer", "no cancer"]
    prior = [base_rate, 1 - base_rate]
    table = BayesTable(hypo, prior)

    sensitivity = 0.734
    specificity = 0.877
    table.likelihood = [sensitivity, 1 - specificity]
    table

    likelihood_ratio = table.likelihood["cancer"] / table.likelihood["no cancer"]

    table.update()
    table

    table.posterior["cancer"] * 100

    # So there is a 1.56% chance that this patient has cancer, given that the initial screening mammogram was positive.
    #
    # This result is called the positive predictive value (PPV) of the test, which we could have read from [the second table](http://www.bcsc-research.org/statistics/performance/screening/2009/perf_age.html)

    # This data was the basis, in 2009, for the recommendation of the US Preventive Services Task Force,
