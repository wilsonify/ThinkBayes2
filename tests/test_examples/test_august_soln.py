    # >The rate of claims-based ADHD diagnosis among children in states with a September 1 cutoff was 85.1 per 10,000 children (309 cases among 36,319 children; 95% confidence interval [CI], 75.6 to 94.2) among those born in August and 63.6 per 10,000 children (225 cases among 35,353 children; 95% CI, 55.4 to 71.9) among those born in September, an absolute difference of 21.5 per 10,000 children (95% CI, 8.8 to 34.0); the corresponding difference in states without the September 1 cutoff was 8.9 per 10,000 children (95% CI, −14.9 to 20.8). The rate of ADHD treatment was 52.9 per 10,000 children (192 of 36,319 children; 95% CI, 45.4 to 60.3) among those born in August and 40.4 per 10,000 children (143 of 35,353 children; 95% CI, 33.8 to 47.1) among those born in September, an absolute difference of 12.5 per 10,000 children (95% CI, 2.43 to 22.4). These differences were not observed for other month-to-month comparisons, nor were they observed in states with non-September cutoff dates for starting kindergarten. In addition, in states with a September 1 cutoff, no significant differences between August-born and September-born children were observed in rates of asthma, diabetes, or obesity.

    # For the first 9 months, from September to May, we see what we would expect if at least some of the excess diagnoses are due to behavioral differences due to age.  For each month of difference in age, we see an increase in the number of diagnoses.
    #
    # This pattern breaks down for the last three months, June, July, and August.  This might be explained by random variation, but it also might be due to parental manipulation; if some parents hold back students born near the deadline, the observations for these month would include a mixture of children who are relatively old for their grade, and therefore less likely to be diagnosed.
    #
    # We could test this hypothesis by checking the actual ages of these students when they started school, rather than just looking at their months of birth.
