"""
The ThinkBayes framework
Introduction
thinkbayes is a Python module that provides a framework for Bayesian statistics.
The most important class is `Suite`, which represents
 a set of hypotheses that are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive; 
in other words, exactly one of the hypotheses is true.  
`Suite` provides a method, `Update`, that performs a Bayesian update.

`Suite` is based on `Pmf`, which represents a probability mass function.
A Pmf is a map from possible values to their probabilities.  
`Pmf` is implemented using a Python dictionary, so the values can be any hashable type.  
The probabilities are normally floating-point.

`Suite` provides `Update`, which performs a Bayesian update.
It calls `Likelihood`, which is provided by a child class, `Coin` in this example.

It also uses `Normalize`, which is provided by `Pmf`.
To use this framework, you normally define a new class that inherits from `Suite`, then provide `Likelihood`.

`thinkplot` is a module that comes with thinkbayes.
It provides wrappers for some of the functions in Matplotlib,
and includes functions like `Pdf` that known how to plot `Suites` and other objects from thinkbayes.
