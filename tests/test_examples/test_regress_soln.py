    # ## Bayesian regression
    #
    # This notebook presents a simple example of Bayesian regression using sythetic data
    #
    # ### Data
    #
    # Suppose there is a linear relationship between `x` and `y` with slope 2 and intercept 1, but the measurements of `y` are noisy; specifically, the noise is Gaussian with mean 0 and `sigma = 0.3`.

    slope = 2
    inter = 1
    sigma = 0.3

    xs = np.linspace(0, 1, 6)

    ys = inter + slope * xs + np.random.normal(0, sigma, len(xs))

    thinkplot.plot(xs, ys)
    thinkplot.decorate(xlabel="x", ylabel="y")

    # ### Grid algorithm
    #
    # We can solve the problem first using a grid algorithm, with uniform priors for slope, intercept, and sigma.
    #
    # As an exercise, fill in this likelihood function, then test it using the code below.
    #
    # Your results will depend on the random data you generated, but in general you should find that the posterior marginal distributions peak near the actual parameters.

    #
    # You also have the option of using the GLM module, [described here](https://docs.pymc.io/notebooks/GLM-linear.html).
