What is a distribution?
An object-oriented exploration of one of the most useful concepts in statistics.

Summary

Abstractly, a distribution is an entity that can answer questions
about the outcomes of random variables and their probabilities.
There are many ways to represent a distribution;
each representation is equivalent to the others in the sense that they contain the same information,
and you can convert from any of them to the others.

Some representations make it easy and efficient to answer some questions,
but none of the representations is best for all of the questions.
In my implementation, a `Dist` object has the attributes and methods of all representations.
From a software engineering point of view, that might not be the best design,
but it is meant to illustrate what it means to be a distribution.
In short, if you give me any representation of a distribution,
you have told me everything I need to know to answer questions about the possible outcomes and their probabilities.
Converting from one representation to another is mostly a matter of convenience and computational efficiency.
Conversely, if you are trying to find the distribution of a random variable,
you can do it by computing whichever representation is easiest to figure out.

    Characteristic function
    At this point we've answered all the questions on the list, but I want to come back to addition,
    because the algorithm we used with the `Pmf` representation is not as efficient as it could be.
    It enumerates all pairs of outcomes, so if there are $n$ values in each `Pmf`, the run time is $O(n^2)$.
    We can do better.
    The key is the **characteristic function**, which is the Fourier transform (FT) of the PMF.
    If you are familiar with the Fourier transform and the Convolution Theorem, keep reading.
    Otherwise, skip the rest of this cell and get to the code, which is much simpler than the explanation.

    ### Details for people who know about convolution
    If you are familiar with the FT in the context of spectral analysis of signals,
    you might wonder why we would possibly want to compute the FT of a PMF.
    The reason is the Convolution Theorem.
    It turns out that the algorithm we used to "add" two `Pmf` objects is a form of convolution.
    To see how that works, suppose we are computing the distribution of $Z = X+Y$.
    To make things concrete, let's compute the probability that the sum, $Z$ is 5.
    To do that, we can enumerate all possible values of $X$ like this:
    $Prob(Z=5) = \sum_x Prob(X=x) \cdot Prob(Y=5-x)$
    Now we can write each of those probabilities in terms of the PMF of $X$, $Y$, and $Z$:
    $PMF_Z(5) = \sum_x PMF_X(x) \cdot PMF_Y(5-x)$
    And now we can generalize by replacing 5 with any value of $z$:
    $PMF_Z(z) = \sum_x PMF_X(x) \cdot PMF_Y(z-x)$
    You might recognize that computation as convolution, denoted with the operator $\ast$.
    $PMF_Z = PMF_X \ast PMF_Y$
    Now, according to the Convolution Theorem:
    $FT(PMF_X \ast Y) = FT(PMF_X) \cdot FT(PMF_Y)$
    Or, taking the inverse FT of both sides:
    $PMF_X \ast PMF_Y = IFT(FT(PMF_X) \cdot FT(PMF_Y))$
    In words, to compute the convolution of $PMF_X$ and $PMF_Y$,
    we can compute the FT of $PMF_X$ and $PMF_Y$ and multiply them together, then compute the inverse FT of the result.
    Let's see how that works.  Here's a class that represents a characteristic function.

    Is that all there is?
    So is a `Pmf` a distribution?
    No.  At least in this framework, a `Pmf` is one of several representations of a distribution.
    Other representations include the **cumulative distribution function**, or CDF, and the **characteristic function**.
    These representations are equivalent in the sense that they all contain the same informaton;
    if I give you any one of them, you can figure out the others (and we'll see how soon).

    So why would we want different representations of the same information?
    The fundamental reason is that there are many different operations we would like to perform with distributions;
    that is, questions we would like to answer.
    Some representations are better for some operations, but none of them is the best for all operations.

    So what are the questions we would like a distribution to answer?  They include:

    *  What is the probability of a given outcome?
    *  What is the mean of the outcomes, taking into account their probabilities?
    *  What is the variance, and other moments, of the outcome?
    *  What is the probability that the outcome exceeds (or falls below) a threshold?
    *  What is the median of the outcomes, that is, the 50th percentile?
    *  What are the other percentiles?
    *  How can get generate a random sample from this distribution, with the appropriate probabilities?
    *  If we run two random processes and choose the maximum of the outcomes (or minimum),
    what is the distribution of the result?
    *  If we run two random processes and add up the results, what is the distribution of the sum?

    Each of these questions corresponds to a method we would like a distribution to provide.
    But as I said, there is no one representation that answers all of them easily and efficiently.
    So let's look at the different representations and see what they can do.

    Getting back to the `Pmf`, we've already seen how to look up the probability of a given outcome.

    Python dictionaries are implemented using hash tables, so we expect `__getitem__` to be fast.
    In terms of algorithmic complexity, it is constant time, or $O(1)$.

    Moments and expecations

    The `Pmf` representation is also good for computing mean, variance, and other moments.
    This implementation is efficient,
    in the sense that it is $O(n)$, and because it uses a comprehension to traverse the outcomes, the overhead is low.
    The implementation of `Pmf.Var` is similar
    And here's how they are used:
    The structure of `Mean` and `Var` is the same:
    they traverse the outcomes and their probabilities, `x` and `p`,
    and add up the product of `p` and some function of `x`.

    """
    d6.Mean(), d6.Var()


def test_third_central_moment(d6):
    r"""
    We can generalize this structure to compute the **expectation** of any function of `x`, which is defined as
    $E[f] = \sum_x p(x) f(x)$

    `Pmf` provides `Expect`, which takes a function object, `func`, and returns the expectation of `func`:
    As an example, we can use `Expect` to compute the third central moment of the distribution:
    Because the distribution is symmetric, the third central moment is 0.
    """
    mu = d6.Mean()
    result = d6.Expect(lambda x: (x - mu) ** 3)
    assert result == 0


def test_addition(d6):
    """
    The next question we'll answer is the last one on the list:
    if we run two random processes and add up the results,
    what is the distribution of the sum?
    In other words, if the result of the first process is a random variable, $X$, and the result of the second is $Y$,
    what is the distribution of $X+Y$?

    The `Pmf` representation of the distribution can answer this question pretty well,
    but we'll see later that the characteristic function is even better.

    The outer loop traverses the outcomes and probabilities of the first `Pmf`;
    the inner loop traverses the second `Pmf`.
    Each time through the loop, we compute the sum of the outcome pair, `v1` and `v2`,
      and the probability that the pair occurs.

    Note that this method implicitly assumes that the two processes are independent;
    that is, the outcome from one does not affect the other.
    That's why we can compute the probability of the pair by multiplying the probabilities of the outcomes.

    To demonstrate this method, we'll start with `d6` again.
    When we use the `+` operator, Python invokes `__add__`, which invokes `AddPmf`, which returns a new `Pmf` object.

    Cumulative probabilities
    The next few questions on the list are related to the median and other percentiles.
    They are harder to answer with the `Pmf` representation,
    but easier with a **cumulative distribution function** (CDF).

    A CDF is a map from an outcome, $x$, to its cumulative probability,
    which is the probability that the outcome is less than or equal to $x$.  In math notation:
    $CDF(x) = Prob(X \le x)$
    where $X$ is the outcome of a random process, and $x$ is the threshold we are interested in.
    For example, if $CDF$ is the cumulative distribution for the sum of three dice,
    the probability of getting 5 or less is $CDF(5)$, and the probability of getting 6 or more is $1 - CDF(5)$.
    `thinkbayes` provides a class called Cdf that represents a cumulative distribution function.
    It uses a sorted list of outcomes and the corresponding list of cumulative probabilities.
    The `__init__` method is complicated because it accepts a lot of different parameters.
    The important part is the last 4 lines.

    `xs` is the sorted list of values, and `freqs` are their frequencies or probabilities.
    `ps` is the list of cumulative frequencies or probabilities,
    which we normalize by dividing through by the last element.
    Here's how we use it to create a `Cdf` object for the sum of three dice:
    Because we have to sort the values, the time to compute a `Cdf` is $O(n \log n)$.

    Here's what the CDF looks like:
    The range of the CDF is always from 0 to 1.

    `Cdf` provides `Probs`, which takes an array of values and returns the corresponding probabilities:

    The details here are a little tricky because we have to deal with some "off by one" problems,
    and if any of the values are less than the smallest value in the `Cdf`,
    we have to handle that as a special case.
    But the basic idea is simple, and the implementation is efficient.

    Now we can look up probabilities for a sequence of values:
    `Cdf` also provides `__getitem__`, so we can use brackets to look up a single value:

    Max and min
    The `Cdf` representation is particularly good for finding the distribution of a maximum.
    For example, in Dungeons and Dragons,
    players create characters with random properties like strength and intelligence.
    The properties are generated by rolling three dice and adding them,
    so the CDF for each property is the `Cdf` we used in this example.
    Each character has 6 properties, so we might wonder what the distribution is for the best of the six.

    To get the distribution of the maximum, we make a new `Cdf` with the same values as the original,
    and with the `ps` raised to the `k`th power.  Simple, right?

    To see how it works, suppose you generate six properties and your best is only a 10.
