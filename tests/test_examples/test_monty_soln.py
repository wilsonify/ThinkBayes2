# **Exercise:** Let's consider [a more general version of the Monty Hall problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem#Other_host_behaviors) where Monty is more unpredictable.  As before, Monty never opens the door you chose (let's call it A) and never opens the door with the prize.  So if you choose the door with the prize, Monty has to decide which door to open.  Suppose he opens B with probability `p` and C with probability `1-p`.
#
# 1.  If you choose A and Monty opens B, what is the probability that the car is behind A, in terms of `p`?
#
# 2.  What if Monty opens C?
#
# Hint: you might want to use SymPy to do the algebra for you.

from sympy import symbols


def test_monty():
    p = symbols("p")

    # Solution

    # Here's the solution if Monty opens B.

    pmf = Pmf("ABC")
    pmf["A"] *= p
    pmf["B"] *= 0
    pmf["C"] *= 1
    pmf.Normalize()
    pmf["A"].simplify()

    # Solution

    # When p=0.5, the result is what we saw before

    pmf["A"].evalf(subs={p: 0.5})

    # Solution

    # When p=0.0, we know for sure that the prize is behind C

    pmf["C"].evalf(subs={p: 0.0})

    # Solution

    # And here's the solution if Monty opens C.

    pmf = Pmf("ABC")
    pmf["A"] *= 1 - p
    pmf["B"] *= 1
    pmf["C"] *= 0
    pmf.Normalize()
    pmf["A"].simplify()
