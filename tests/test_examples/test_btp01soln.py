    The place: Airstrip One. The reason: thoughtcrime. The time: ???
    John's parents were taken by the Thought Police and erased from all records.
    John is being initiated into the Youth League and must pass a test.
    He is asked whether his parents are good comrades.
    It is not clear what John's admission officer knows:

    1. He may know that John's parents have been erased and that John did not give them away.
    2. He may know only that John's parents have been erased.
    3. He may not know that John's parents have been erased.

    It is a well known fact that children who have parents that are 'good comrades'
    have twice the chances of passing the test.
    However, if the admission officer knows that their parents committed thoughtcrime
    (but not that they have been erased yet), a child that gave his parents away has three times
    the chances of getting in than a child who did not give them away.

    And if the admission officer knows the specifics of the arrest,
    a child that denies that the records are false and their parents existed has a 1/3 chance of getting in,
    while one who pretends that his parents never existed has a 2/3 chance.
    Lying to an admission officer that knows the parents have been erased will ensure that the child does not get in.
    Telling an admission officer that your parents do not exist
    when he does not know this will give you a 1/3 chance of getting in.

    There is a 60% chance the admission officer knows nothing,
    a 25% chance that he knows the parents have been erased, and
    a 15% chance that the officer knows all of the details.

    Where Am I? - The Robot Localization Problem
    by Kathryn Hite

    Bayes's Theorem proves to be extremely useful when building mobile robots
    that need to know where they are within an environment at any given time.
    Because of the error in motion and sensor systems,
    a robot's knowledge of its location in the world is based on probabilities.

    Let's look at a simplified example that could feasibly be scaled up to create a working localization model.

    **Part A:**
    We have a robot that exists within a very simple environement.
    The map for this environment is a row of 6 grid cells that are colored
    either green or red and each labeled $x_1$, $x_2$, etc.
    In real life, a larger form of this grid environment could make up what is known as an occupancy grid,
    or a map of the world with places that the robot can go represented as green cells and obstacles as red cells.

    |G|R|R|G|G|G|
    |-|-|-|-|-|-|
    |$x_1$|$x_2$|$x_3$|$x_4$|$x_5$|$x_6$|

    The robot has a sensor that can detect color with an 80% chance of being accurate.

    Given that the robot gets dropped in the environment and senses **red**,
    what is the probability of it being in each of the six locations?

    The robot moves forward one cell from its previous position and the sensor reads **green**,

    In this case, the likelihood of the data is the same regardless of
    which die I rolled, so the posterior is the same as the prior.
