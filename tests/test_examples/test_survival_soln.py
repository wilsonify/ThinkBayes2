    # **Exercise:** Write a class called `LightBulb` that inherits from `Suite` and `Joint` and provides a `Likelihood` function that takes an observed lifespan as data and a tuple, `(lam, k)`, as a hypothesis.  It should return a likelihood proportional to the probability of the observed lifespan in a Weibull distribution with the given parameters.
    #
    # Test your method by creating a `LightBulb` object with an appropriate prior and update it with a random sample from a Weibull distribution.
    #
    # Plot the posterior distributions of `lam` and `k`.  As the sample size increases, does the posterior distribution converge on the values of `lam` and `k` used to generate the sample?


    # Solution

            lam, k = hypo

    # **Exercise:** Now suppose that instead of observing a lifespan, `k`, you observe a lightbulb that has operated for 1 year and is still working.  Write another version of `LightBulb` that takes data in this form and performs an update.


    # Solution

    # **Exercise:** Now let's put it all together.  Suppose you have 15 lightbulbs installed at different times over a 10 year period.  When you observe them, some have died and some are still working.  Write a version of `LightBulb` that takes data in the form of a `(flag, x)` tuple, where:
    #
    # 1. If `flag` is `eq`, it means that `x` is the actual lifespan of a bulb that has died.
    # 2. If `flag` is `gt`, it means that `x` is the current age of a bulb that is still working, so it is a lower bound on the lifespan.
    #
    # To help you test, I will generate some fake data.
    #
    # First, I'll generate a Pandas DataFrame with random start times and lifespans.  The columns are:
    #
    # `start`: time when the bulb was installed
    #
    # `lifespan`: lifespan of the bulb in years
    #
    # `end`: time when bulb died or will die
    #
    # `age_t`: age of the bulb at t=10


    import pandas as pd

    lam = 2
    k = 1.5
    n = 15
    t_end = 10
    starts = np.random.uniform(0, t_end, n)
    lifespans = SampleWeibull(lam, k, n)

    df = pd.DataFrame({"start": starts, "lifespan": lifespans})
    df["end"] = df.start + df.lifespan
    df["age_t"] = t_end - df.start

    df.head()
    

    # Now I'll process the DataFrame to generate data in the form we want for the update.


    data = []
    for i, row in df.iterrows():
        if row.end < t_end:
            data.append(("eq", row.lifespan))

    # **Exercise:** Suppose you install a light bulb and then you don't check on it for a year, but when you come back, you find that it has burned out.  Extend `LightBulb` to handle this kind of data, too.


    # Solution


    class LightBulb4(Suite, Joint):
        def Likelihood(self, data, hypo):
            lam, k = hypo

    # ## Prediction
    #
    # **Exercise:** Suppose we know that, for a particular kind of lightbulb in a particular location, the distribution of lifespans is well modeled by a Weibull distribution with `lam=2` and `k=1.5`.  If we install `n=100` lightbulbs and come back one year later, what is the distribution of `c`, the number of lightbulbs that have burned out?


    # Solution

    # The probability that any given bulb has burned out comes from the CDF of the distribution
    p = EvalWeibullCdf(1, lam, k)
    p


    # Solution

    # The number of bulbs that have burned out is distributed Binom(n, p)
    n = 100
    from thinkbayes import MakeBinomialPmf

    pmf_c = MakeBinomialPmf(n, p)
    thinkplot.Pdf(pmf_c)
    

    # **Exercise:** Now suppose that `lam` and `k` are not known precisely, but we have a `LightBulb` object that represents the joint posterior distribution of the parameters after seeing some data.  Compute the posterior predictive distribution for `c`, the number of bulbs burned out after one year.
