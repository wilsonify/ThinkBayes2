# ## The social desirability problem
#
# Whenever you survey people about sensitive issues, you have to deal with [social desirability bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_desirability_bias), which is the tendency of people to shade their answers in the direction they think shows them in the most positive light.
#
# One of the ways to improve the quality of the results is to collect responses in indirect ways.  For example, [here's a clever way one research group estimated the prevalence of atheists](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/way-more-americans-may-be-atheists-than-we-thought/).
#
# Another way is [randomized response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_response), as described in [this presentation](http://www.soz.unibe.ch/ueber_uns/personen/jann/presentations_by_ben_jann/e131361/e131381/rrt_online07_kassel08_ger.pdf) or [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwJ0qY_rP0A).
#
# As an example, suppose you ask 100 people to flip a coin and:
#
# * If they get heads, they honestly answer the question "Do you believe in God?"
#
# * If they get tails, they flip a second coin and report YES for heads, tails for NO.
#
# Assume that you cannot observe whether they flip one coin or two.
# And suppose you get 55 YESes and 45 NOs.
#
# 1. Estimate the prevalence of believers in the surveyed population (by which, as always, I mean compute a posterior distribution).
#
# 2. How efficient is this method?  That is, how does the width of the posterior distribution compare to the distribution you would get if 100 people answered the question honestly?
