    # But we don't have a given value of `mu`, we have a whole bunch of values for `mu`, with different probabilities.
    #
    # So the posterior predictive distribution is a mixture of Poissons with different weights.
    #
    # The simplest way to generate the posterior predictive distribution is to
    #
    # 1. Draw a random `mu` from the posterior distribution.
    #
    # 2. Draw a random number of goals from `Poisson(mu)`.

    # 2. Even if we knew `mu`, we would not know the score of the next game.
    #
    # It is tempting, but wrong, to generate a posterior prediction by taking the mean of the posterior distribution and drawing samples from `Poisson(mu)` with just a single value of `mu`.

    # ## Going hierarchical
    #
    # So far, all of this is based on a gamma prior.  To choose the parameters of the prior, I used data from previous Stanley Cup finals and computed a maximum likelihood estimate (MLE).  But that's not correct, because
    #
    # 1. It assumes that the observed goal counts are the long-term goal-scoring rates.
    # 2. It treats `alpha` and `beta` as known values rather than parameters to estimate.
    #
    # In other words, I have ignored two important sources of uncertainty.  As a result, my predictions are almost certainly too confident.
    #
    # The solution is a hierarchical model, where `alpha` and `beta` are the parameters that control `mu` and `mu` is the parameter that controls `goals`.  Then we can use observed `goals` to update the distributions of all three unknown parameters.
    #
    # Of course, now we need a prior distribution for `alpha` and `beta`.  A common choice is the half Cauchy distribution (see [Gelman](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/taumain.pdf)), but on advice of counsel, I'm going with exponential.
