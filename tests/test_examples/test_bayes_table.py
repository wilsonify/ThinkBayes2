This notebook demonstrates a way of doing simple Bayesian updates using the table method,
with a Pandas DataFrame as the table.

    Suppose you put the first cookie back, stir the bowl, and select another cookie from the same bowl.
    If this second cookie is chocolate, what is the probability, now, that you are drawing from Bowl 1?
