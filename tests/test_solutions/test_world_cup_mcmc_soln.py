# ## The World Cup Problem, Part One
#
# >In the 2014 FIFA World Cup, Germany played Brazil in a semifinal match. Germany scored after 11 minutes and again at the 23 minute mark. At that point in the match, how many goals would you expect Germany to score after 90 minutes? What was the probability that they would score 5 more goals (as, in fact, they did)?

# Let's assume that Germany has some hypothetical goal-scoring rate, λ, in goals per game.
#
# To represent the prior distribution of λ, I'll use a Gamma distribution with mean 1.3, which is the average number of goals per team per game in World Cup play.
#
# Here's what the prior looks like.
